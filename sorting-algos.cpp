// This is a comprehesive list of the most known sorting algorithms

//BUBBLE SORT:
// The simplest in terms of code but it's the most inefficient: The number of iterations can be much higher than the elements to sort.


//SELECTION SORT:


//QUICK SORT:



// OTHER (COMPLEX) SORTING ALGORITHMS: 
/*
	INSERTION SORT -------- Improved version of selection sort.
	MODIFIED BUBBLE SORT --	Improved version of bubble sort.
	EXCHANGE SORT --------- Similar to bubble sort, but compares elements to the first value.
	SHELL SORT ------------ Similar to bubble sort, but compares elements that are a certain distance away from each other.
	HEAP SORT -------------	Similat to selection sort, but uses a 'heap' data structure for storage.
	MERGE SORT ------------ Similar to quicksort, but combines sorted arrays (partitions) and can be used effectively with linked lists.
